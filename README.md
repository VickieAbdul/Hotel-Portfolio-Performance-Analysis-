# Milton Hotels: Revenue, Operations & Cost Optimization Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes operational, financial, guest experience, and energy data from the Milton Hotels portfolio to understand how the company can grow revenue while maintaining guest satisfaction and controlling costs.
The analysis is designed to simulate a real-world business problem and provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Business Problem
How can Milton Hotels increase revenue and guest satisfaction while controlling operational and energy costs across its hotel portfolio?


---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains daily hotel-level data including:
- Financial performance (ADR, RevPAR, Revenue)
- Guest experience (Satisfaction Score)
- Operational efficiency (Check-in time, Housekeeping turnover, Staffing)
- Sustainability metrics (Energy consumption per room)
---

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab
- Power BI (for dashboarding and visualization)
---

## Analysis Structure

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Standardized column names
- Converted date fields
- Created derived metrics (e.g., occupancy rate)
- Validated revenue calculations

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### EDA 4.1 — Revenue Structure
- Compared pricing (ADR) vs demand (occupancy)
- Found that pricing has a stronger relationship with revenue (RevPAR)

#### EDA 4.2 — Guest Satisfaction Drivers
- Analyzed operational and demand-related factors
- Found guest satisfaction to be stable across different conditions

#### EDA 4.3 — Operational Efficiency
- Tested whether higher occupancy creates bottlenecks
- Found operations scale effectively with demand

#### EDA 4.4 — Energy Efficiency
- Analyzed energy usage relative to occupancy and revenue
- Found energy consumption per room remains stable as demand increases
---

## Key Insights
- RevPAR is driven more by ADR than occupancy.
- Guest satisfaction is not strongly influenced by operational timing metrics.
- Operational efficiency remains stable across hotels.
- Energy consumption does not show a strong trade-off with revenue.
- Overall hotel performance is balanced with no major bottlenecks.
---

## Recommendations
- Focus on pricing optimization to drive revenue growth.
- Maintain current operational standards to protect guest experience.
- Avoid unnecessary increases in staffing or energy spending.
- Use hotel-level analysis to identify underperforming properties.
---

## Executive Conclusion 
Milton Hotels shows stable performance across revenue, guest satisfaction, and operational efficiency. Revenue growth is mainly influenced by pricing strategy rather than occupancy levels. 
There are no major operational bottlenecks affecting guest experience. The business can focus on optimizing pricing strategy while maintaining operational consistency.

## Next Steps
- Perform hotel-level segmentation to identify high- and low-performing property clusters
- Conduct seasonal and regional performance analysis
- Explore predictive modeling for revenue and occupancy forecasting
